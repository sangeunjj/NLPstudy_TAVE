## 📚 Project Overview

This study group was formed as part of TAVE's 14th cohort activities, focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs). All study content, curriculum, and learning materials were planned and created by our team leader, HyunJung Jung. We document our learning journey as we explore various key technologies in the NLP landscape.

Our study approach includes:
- Reading and discussing original research papers
- Implementing mini-projects based on those papers
- Conducting detailed code reviews
- Line-by-line code analysis to deepen understanding

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- **Foundational Models**: RNN, LSTM
- **Advanced Architectures**: Transformer, BERT, T5, GPT
- **LLM Applications**: Langchain, RAG, REACT, Retrieval

## 📅 Schedule

We meet twice a week: Tuesdays (19:00-21:00) and Saturdays (14:00-16:00)

| Date | Topic |
|------|-------|
| September 14 | RNN & LSTM |
| September 21 | Transformer |
| September 24 | BERT |
| September 28 | Generative AI |
| September 30 | Prompt Engineering |
| October 12 | REACT |

| October 19 | Implementation Practice & Wrap-up |

## 🔍 Study Method

For each topic, our study process follows these steps:

1. **Paper Reading**: Understanding the theoretical foundations
2. **Implementation**: Following tutorials to build mini-projects
3. **Code Review**: Group analysis of implementation details
4. **Line-by-Line Analysis**: Deep dive into code functionality
